overview_blurb: 'The overview table shows the assessments of the indicators from previous years,
  indicating whether the weather symbol for an indicator has been stable or rather volatile in the past.<br>
  The assessments presented are based on the data status as of July 2025. More recent data may be available on the online platform, as it is updated regularly.<br>
  <br>The print version of the indicator status overview can be found <a href="https://dns-indikatoren.de/public/Statusübersicht_2025_En.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>
  <h3 class="h3bold">Indicators with several targets</h3><br>
  For indicators with several targets that are to be achieved sequentially (for example, indicator <a href="https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/status_summary/#7.1.b%20Primary%20energy%20consumption">7.1.b</a>),
  the assessments for achieving each individual target are provided. The same applies to indicators
  with several targets that are intended to be achieved simultaneously (for example, indicator
  <a href="https://dns-indikatoren.de/en/status_summary/#10.1%20Foreign%20school%20graduates">10.1</a>).<br><br>
  <h3 class="h3bold">Indicators with target adjustments</h3><br>
  In addition to the currently valid targets of the Federal Government, targets that applied in the past but have since been adjusted are also shown.<br><br>
  All weather symbols for targets that are currently not valid are shown in grey because:
  <ul>
  <li>the target was amended in the past,</li>
  <li>a nearer-term target must be achieved first, or</li>
  <li>the target is only one of several that are to be achieved simultaneously.</li>
  </ul>'
